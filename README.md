# Planet-Hunter
Planet Hunter, a game for the Commodore 64

This is a lazy sunday project that turned into a game.

If you randomly print the PETSCII part circle chars
(IJKU) continuously, sometimes they form a circle on the screen.
Lets call it a planet.
When the chars are printed one at a time
you can spot the planets easily.
But what if the entire screen is filled at once,
how fast can you spot ALL the planets?

This is where the game Planet Hunter enters the scene.

Game Story:
An old spacecraft that had almost no power left, was
left to search for planets using a simple scanner.
The simple scanner (v0.1) was programmed in a hurry.
It works but it is slow.
The plot of the game is to spot how many planets
are in the antenna data, as quickly as you can.
Can you beat the simple scanner?
How many levels can you reach before bad things happen?

Some "Quirks" are "Features". Some features are hidden.

Good luck hunting! :-)
